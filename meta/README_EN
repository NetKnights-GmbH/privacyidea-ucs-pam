<p>
privacyIDEA PAM is a module that can be used to authenticate at PAM based systems like
SSH with a second factor. This second factor is managed by a privacyIDEA server that
is installed somewhere in your network.
</p>
<p>
You can configure privacyIDEA PAM using UCR variables:
<ul>
<li><b>privacyidea/pam/url</b> The URL of the privacyIDEA server.
</li>
<li><b>privacyidea/pam/enable</b> Set to "1" to enable OTP authentication.
   PAM will be configured this way, that you need to authenticate with two factors against privacyIDEA.
   If this authentication fails, you can authenticate with the Domain password. For more sophisticated 
   authentication scenarios, please contact the support of the vendor.
</li>
<li><b>auth/umc/addon/privacyidea</b> Set this to "1" or True, to add two factor authentication with privacyIDEA to 
  <em>Univention Management Console</em>.
  For more detailed configuration and setup please contact the support of the vendor or read the
  <a href="https://netknights.it/two-factor-authentication-at-the-univention-management-console/">Blog entry</a>.

</ul>
